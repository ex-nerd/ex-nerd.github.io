      <description>The Trossingen Lyre was uncovered in a 6th century gravesite in modern day Germany, and represents the most complete Anglo-Saxon lyre found to date. After making a prototype lyre out of plywood (links and more info for that coming soon), I decided to try my hand at this more difficult project.
This is an ongoing project, so I will be updating this page as often as I can.
You can read more about the original lyre in the German Wikipedia article about the Trossingen Lyre (English translation).</description>
