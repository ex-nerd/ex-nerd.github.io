      <title>Low Carb Waffles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_of_adults&#34;&gt;Type 1 Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; means that I have to closely watch my carbohydrate intake, and it&#39;s easier to do this by eating low-carb foods that make the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diabeticlifestyle.com/blood-glucose/carb-counting-insulin-math-diabetes&#34;&gt;math&lt;/a&gt; easier.  Since I don&#39;t want to give up on some of the finer things in life &amp;ndash; like waffles &amp;ndash; I spent some time formulating a decent substitute for carb-heavy grain-based waffles.  This lets me have a fairly large breakfast of applesauce, yogurt, and definitely-not-maple (but passable) syrup and still keep things under 45g of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tor&#39;s Hard Cider Recipe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had enough people ask about a simple cider recipe that I decided to post it here.  This recipe originates from my friend
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.welandsmithy.com/&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and is definitely not the finest
of brews, but it&#39;s one &lt;strong&gt;heck&lt;/strong&gt; of a strong cider.  So-called &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; brewers
may scoff at the idea of using bread yeast, but keep in mind that things (flavor in particular) work differently with cider than beer or wine, and don&#39;t
knock it until you taste it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Old Fashioned Root Beer, with a twist</title>
      <link>http://ex-nerd.com/food/root-beer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sassafras is the &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; in root beer. However, in the mid-60&#39;s, the FDA
discovered that a chemical in sassafras called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safrole&#34;&gt;safrole&lt;/a&gt; caused cancer in rats, and
proceded to ban its sale for edible uses. This sent the root beer industry into
a frenzy trying to find a replacement flavor (they eventually came up with
something that&#39;s a combination of licorice root &amp;ndash; that&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; anise, and
doesn&#39;t taste like it &amp;ndash; and wintergreen).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
