      <title>Kinds of Diabetes: Car Analogy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes Mellitus is a 500 year old term that describes the sweet-smelling urine
of people whose bodies have stopped being able to regulate blood sugar properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that it refers to a family of different (and largely unrelated)
diseases that all have the same symptoms before doctors can determine what has
caused them. People &amp;ndash; even doctors &amp;ndash; still have trouble understanding the
differences between these diseases, so I tried to come up with a simple and
(hopefully) humerous analogy by thinking of each disease as a problem with your
car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Type 1 Diabetes Name History</title>

      <description>This page is sort of a living document about my research into the naming history of autoimmune diabetes mellitus, more commonly known as Type 1 Diabetes.
There are obviously a lot of missing sections but I&#39;ve been promising to get this posted for several years and I figure this is the best way to encourage myself to finish.
Diabetes Mellitus The name &amp;ldquo;Diabetes Mellitus&amp;rdquo; dates back roughly 500 years, and awarness of the disease by other names (e.</description>

      <title>Making a Trossingen Lyre</title>
      <link>http://ex-nerd.com/making/trossingen-lyre/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trossingen Lyre was uncovered in a 6th century gravesite in modern day
Germany, and represents the most complete Anglo-Saxon lyre found to date. After
making a prototype lyre out of plywood (links and more info for that coming
soon), I decided to try my hand at this more difficult project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;strong&gt;ongoing&lt;/strong&gt; project, so I will be updating this page as often as I can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Participate in Clinical Research!</title>

      <description>Photos like this one are fairly common in Type 1 Diabetes forums, usually accompanied by a comment like &amp;ldquo;DKA sucks!&amp;quot;, making light of the extremely unpleasant and occasionally deadly Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I decided to post a similar photo but with a positive story behind it. So this is me, sitting in a hospital bed in the research wing of a local hospital while they spent several hours measuring how my body reacts when I drink a high carb/protein shake and don&#39;t take insulin for it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I plan to eventually write about a bunch of these topics individually.  Until then,
here is my collection of links to a number of diabetes-releated topics that I have found
especially helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Low Carb Waffles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_of_adults&#34;&gt;Type 1 Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; means that I have to closely watch my carbohydrate intake, and it&#39;s easier to do this by eating low-carb foods that make the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diabeticlifestyle.com/blood-glucose/carb-counting-insulin-math-diabetes&#34;&gt;math&lt;/a&gt; easier.  Since I don&#39;t want to give up on some of the finer things in life &amp;ndash; like waffles &amp;ndash; I spent some time formulating a decent substitute for carb-heavy grain-based waffles.  This lets me have a fairly large breakfast of applesauce, yogurt, and definitely-not-maple (but passable) syrup and still keep things under 45g of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Who am I? My name is Chris Petersen.
I graduated from the stereotypical social awkwardness a long time ago and now focus my attention on things that a lot of us recovering nerds enjoy: family, food, friends, beer, and a little smattering of technology (I can’t stray too far from my roots). That said, I’m still a total geek, in both the old nerdy definition as well as the newer &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; meaning.</description>

      <title>keeping your digital life secure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of high-profile stories recently about hacking and digital identity theft, along with a rash of hacked yahoo.com email accounts that usually lead to scams/cons. When a number of my friends and family members fell victim to these hacks (thankfully not to the scams) and discovered that the collateral damage could be worse than the hack itself, I decided that I should put together some recommendations to help them avoid more trouble in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>plus addressing for email</title>
      <link>http://ex-nerd.com/tech/plus-addressing-for-email/</link>

      <guid>http://ex-nerd.com/tech/plus-addressing-for-email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like most tech-savvy people, I have more than a handful of email addresses, and I like to guard them against being shared without my permission (and track back to the company that did the sharing).  When you run your own mail server, this is quite easy &amp;ndash; just make up a custom email address for every company you do business with.  Unfortunately, this gets somewhat cumbersome after awhile, and definitely isn&#39;t a solution for the general public.  Enter &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_addressing#Sub-addressing&#34;&gt;plus addressing&lt;/a&gt;, a method built into most mail servers that allows users to modify their own email addresses with additional data that can be tracked but does not interfere with mail delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the perfect solution if it was actually supported by the majority of online account providers (and in the 6 years since this article was originally written, things aren&#39;t much better).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tor&#39;s Hard Cider Recipe</title>
      <link>http://ex-nerd.com/food/hard-cider-recipe/</link>

      <guid>http://ex-nerd.com/food/hard-cider-recipe/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had enough people ask about a simple cider recipe that I decided to post it here.  This recipe originates from my friend
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.welandsmithy.com/&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and is definitely not the finest
of brews, but it&#39;s one &lt;strong&gt;heck&lt;/strong&gt; of a strong cider.  So-called &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; brewers
may scoff at the idea of using bread yeast, but keep in mind that things (flavor in particular) work differently with cider than beer or wine, and don&#39;t
knock it until you taste it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Old Fashioned Root Beer, with a twist</title>
      <link>http://ex-nerd.com/food/root-beer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sassafras is the &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; in root beer. However, in the mid-60&#39;s, the FDA
discovered that a chemical in sassafras called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safrole&#34;&gt;safrole&lt;/a&gt; caused cancer in rats, and
proceded to ban its sale for edible uses. This sent the root beer industry into
a frenzy trying to find a replacement flavor (they eventually came up with
something that&#39;s a combination of licorice root &amp;ndash; that&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; anise, and
doesn&#39;t taste like it &amp;ndash; and wintergreen).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
