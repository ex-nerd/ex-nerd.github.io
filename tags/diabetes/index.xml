      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes Mellitus is a 500 year old term that describes the sweet-smelling urine
of people whose bodies have stopped being able to regulate blood sugar properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that it refers to a family of different (and largely unrelated)
diseases that all have the same symptoms before doctors can determine what has
caused them. People &amp;ndash; even doctors &amp;ndash; still have trouble understanding the
differences between these diseases, so I tried to come up with a simple and
(hopefully) humerous analogy by thinking of each disease as a problem with your

      <description>Photos like this one are fairly common in Type 1 Diabetes forums, usually accompanied by a comment like &amp;ldquo;DKA sucks!&amp;quot;, making light of the extremely unpleasant and occasionally deadly Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I decided to post a similar photo but with a positive story behind it. So this is me, sitting in a hospital bed in the research wing of a local hospital while they spent several hours measuring how my body reacts when I drink a high carb/protein shake and don&#39;t take insulin for it.</description>
