<p>Hi, you&rsquo;ve found my &ldquo;full&rdquo; resume (i.e. curriculum vitae). It isn&rsquo;t tailored for any specific job application, and contains a very wide sampling of skills and experience (often not specifically related to my chosen profession in technology).  I mostly use it as a conversation starter before providing a more concise/professional PDF version.</p>
<p>This is always my most up-to-date resume — if you ask me for an updated version, I will just send you this URL.</p>
<p>If you have my phone number on file, please do not call it. I don&rsquo;t answer unknown numbers and you are much more likely to receive a reply by sending job details to me via email. I check my email regularly and will reply quickly if I&rsquo;m interested.</p>
<!-- However, I am not looking for employment at the moment. I am happily employed in a job that I enjoy. That doesn't mean that I'm not open to considering other opportunities, but it does mean that I have no interest in contract positions, anything outside of the Seattle area, or anything that pays less than what I currently make (so please provide salary ranges if you decide to contact me). -->

<hr />
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>In my career as a software engineer/architect, I have worked extensively with
most of the popular technology stacks in use over the last 25+ years and
dabbled with most of the others. I love designing APIs that are intuitive for
other developers to use and understand, and systems that operate efficiently
and are easy for future generations of developers to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="computer-skills-and-buzzwords">COMPUTER SKILLS AND BUZZWORDS</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Software development</strong>:  I have most recently used Python/cython, Go, Java,
and UNIX shell scripting. Comfortable but rusty with Perl, Ruby/Rails, PHP,
C#/.NET, and Javascript. Reading knowledge of Objective C, C, and C++.</li>
<li><strong>Database design</strong>:  Considerable knowledge of design, administration, and
performance tuning of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. I also have experience
with NoSQL, graph, and document-based systems like ArangoDB, ElasticSearch
(lucene), Memcached, Redis, and Solr.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as code</strong>: Automated infrastructure using tools like
Ansible, Terraform, Chef, and AWS CloudFormation.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Services</strong>: Extensive experience using and administering AWS services
like IAM, EC2, S3, Mechanical Turk, and more (they keep adding things!), but
I have also worked with Google Cloud services and APIs, and to a lesser
extent with Digital Ocean, Azure, and Rackspace.</li>
<li><strong>Project management</strong>:  I am a strong believer in Stanford Design Thinking
and identifying/solving the underlying problem rather than what the user
perceives the problem to be. I have also been a Certified Scrum Master
(renewal lapsed<!-- #111943 -->), and have experience with a variety of
other agile practices.</li>
<li><strong>Web design</strong>:  Though I prefer to focus on the back-end side of things, I
started my career as a full stack web developer. When needed, I can hold my
own when it comes to modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I have a great
deal of experience with SEO (search engine optimization) and web-based user
interface design.</li>
<li>Expert knowledge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STFW">RTFM and STFW</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relevant-experience">RELEVANT EXPERIENCE</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sr. Software Engineer: <a href="https://xinova.com">Xinova</a></strong>
<em>Seattle, WA, 4/30/18 to 8/31/20</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Engineer and back-end architect on Xinova&rsquo;s &ldquo;global market network&rdquo;
platform team responsible for designing and implementing what will
effectively be a &ldquo;social&rdquo; network and workflow engine that connects our
partners with the world&rsquo;s skilled innovators, and tracks their interactions
from idea to implementation.</li>
<li>Worked closely with front-end engineers, product, and business managers to
pivot from REST-based API served by an overly complex and inflexible
network of golang microservices to a more agile GraphQL service
(Ariadne/Python3) better suited to changing business needs and
significantly smaller development team, with a focus on performance, rapid
development, and easy learning curve for future engineers.</li>
<li>Primary contributor to design and implementation of
all back-end services and infrastructure, from the application itself to
developer environment/tools, CI/CD deployment Google Cloud, and management
of the production ArangoDB cluster.</li>
<li>Designed flexible ACL system using ArangoDB&rsquo;s graph query system, capable
of enforcing access control based on arbitrary criteria to fit business
needs.</li>
<li>Tutor front-end engineers in Python3 and ArangoDB&rsquo;s AQL language.</li>
<li><em>Pre-pivot:</em>
<ul>
<li>Help grow team from 5 engineers to approximately 15 (plus product and
design) while developing a large microservice platform in golang running on
kubernetes in Google Cloud, along with Postgres, Elasticsearch, Docusign,
and other related technologies. Work was shared evenly among the team but
my personal contributions focused heavily on contract management
(Docusign), Elasticsearch, and the beginnings of data collection for
analytics, metrics, and machine learning.</li>
<li>Worked closely with other senior engineers, and mentored less-experienced
engineers in systems architecture and API design.</li>
</ul>
