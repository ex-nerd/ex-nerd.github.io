        <p>Diabetes Mellitus is a 500 year old term that describes the sweet-smelling urine
of people whose bodies have stopped being able to regulate blood sugar properly.</p>
<p>We now know that it refers to a family of different (and largely unrelated)
diseases that all have the same symptoms before doctors can determine what has
caused them. People &ndash; even doctors &ndash; still have trouble understanding the
differences between these diseases, so I tried to come up with a simple and
(hopefully) humorous analogy by thinking of each disease as a problem with your
car.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>While it is possible to <em>biologically</em> have more than one of the conditions
described below, the <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S27/157566/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes">current <em>medical</em> classification
system (2025)</a> and icd10
coding for diabetes mellitus only allows for recognition that a patient has one
kind of diabetes. The type of diabetes a person has is determined based on the
&ldquo;root cause&rdquo; that triggered it, rather than the symptoms (similarly to how we
differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia).</p>
<h2 id="type-1">Type 1</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your washer fluid (something designed to make your car easier/safer to drive)
is leaking onto the gas tank and causing it to rust and leak. It might take
weeks or months, but you eventually won&rsquo;t be able to put anymore gas into your
car unless you find a way to bypass the tank and get fuel into the lines
through some other means (maybe a small tank that sits next to you on the
passenger seat, with a hand pump you can squeeze to get fuel into the engine).</p>
<p>For half of you, the mechanic thinks you&rsquo;re driving an SUV (even if you
aren&rsquo;t), doesn&rsquo;t bother to look at your gas tank, and just tells you to start
adding fuel efficiency additives.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes">Type 1 diabetes</a> is an
autoimmune disease, caused when the body&rsquo;s own immune system destroys the cells
that produce insulin. It can come on quickly over days or weeks (usually in
kids) or slow over months or even years (usually in adults). While the exact
causes are unknown, it is suspected that the disease is &ldquo;activated&rdquo; in people
with at-risk genes by some sort of environmental trigger event (e.g. illness,
stress, pregnancy).</p>
<p>Despite once being called Juvenile Diabetes, more than half of all new cases of
Type 1 are in adults. If misdiagnosis rates were to be corrected, that number
would climb to 75%. This means that half of people with type 1 remain
misdiagnosed as type 2.</p>
<h2 id="type-1b-idiopathic">Type 1b (idiopathic)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your gas tank is rusting and quickly starting to leak, but the mechanic hasn&rsquo;t
been able to figure out why it&rsquo;s happening.</p></blockquote>
<p>The term
<a href="https://www.healthcentral.com/article/idiopathic-diabetes">idiopathic diabetes</a>
has been used for decades to describe a condition that looks and acts like type
1 (thus its classification as type 1b), but the underlying cause cannot
immediately be identified. There is a strong suspicion that we have not yet
identified all of the kinds of autoantibodies associated with type 1 (e.g. the
fairly recent discovery of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_transporter_8">ZnT8 autoantibodies</a>), but
there may also be other causes. Diagnosis of type 1b is strongly associated with
people of African and Asian descent.</p>
<h2 id="type-2">Type 2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re driving an SUV. There are additives that you can add to your fuel to
get better fuel efficiency, but they&rsquo;re usually expensive and work best with
premium fuel. If you don&rsquo;t use these, your fuel efficiency will continue to
get worse.</p>
<p>Friends and strangers ridicule you for buying a gas-guzzling SUV, even though
actually got it as a gift from your parents and can&rsquo;t afford a different car.</p>
<p>20% of you aren&rsquo;t actually driving an SUV, but your mechanic insists that you
are, even if those fuel additives aren&rsquo;t working.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2">Type 2 diabetes</a> is a
metabolic disorder associated with a body&rsquo;s inability to use insulin
efficiently. Up to 1/3 of Americans have or are at risk of developing this
disease. No one knows what causes this disease, but genetics contribute
significantly to your risk. It is not caused by eating too much sugar or being
overweight, but these activities do significantly increase your risk.
Increased insulin resistance (whether from type 2, PCOS, or metabolic syndrome)
has been known to cause weight gain. It can&rsquo;t be cured, but some people with
Type 2 are able to effectly keep the disease in remission through medication,
and careful control over diet and exercise.</p>
<p>Despite being the most common form of diabetes, it is also one of the least
understood. The official classification for type 2 basically says that it is the
diabetes you have if you do <em>not</em> have any other kind of diabetes.</p>
<p>Approximately 20% of people currently diagnosed as type 2 are misdiagnosed and
actually have type 1, type 3c, or MODY.</p>
<h2 id="type-3c">Type 3c</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You got rear-ended and your gas tank was damaged so it no longer holds fuel.
You might not even have a gas tank anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like type 1, but you also have to deal with all of the other problems
caused by the collision.</p>
<p>Almost all of you are told to just start putting efficiency additives and
better fuel into your gas tank.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_3c_(Pancreatogenic)_Diabetes">Type 3c or pancreoprivic diabetes</a>
is caused when the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are damaged by
another disease like pancreatitis or <a href="https://www.cff.org/Life-With-CF/Daily-Life/Cystic-Fibrosis-Related-Diabetes/">cystic fibrosis</a>.
It used to be considered secondary diabetes, but is so prevalent it now has its
own classification.</p>
<p>It is estimated that over 97% of people with type 3c are currently misdiagnosed
as another kind of diabetes.</p>
<h2 id="type-5">Type 5</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t afford gas when your car was new, but you drove it anyway. This
damaged the fuel system so it no longer works properly.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2025, this <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/malnutrition-related-diabetes-officially-named-type-5-2025a10008pd">newly-classified form of diabetes</a>
describes a form where severe childhood malnutrition damages the pancreas enough
that it no longer effectively produces insulin. The disease presents similarly to
and is treated as type 1, but recognizing the cause is malnutrition may allow for
the discovery of additional treatments.</p>
<h2 id="secondary-diabetes">Secondary diabetes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s like type 3c but instead of being rear-ended, it&rsquo;s likely that your
mechanic accidentally poked a hole in your gas tank.</p></blockquote>
<p>Secondary diabetes is caused by damage to the insulin-producing cells in the
pancreas by some external factor not specifically described by another type. The
most common form of secondary diabetes is drug-induced diabetes resulting from
side effects to medications like chemotherapy.</p>
<h2 id="mody-maturity-onset-diabetes-of-the-young">MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize it but you&rsquo;re driving a Yugo, one of 11 specific kinds of
car that just weren&rsquo;t built to run properly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>very</strong> expensive and time consuming to run a check on your VIN and see
if your car is one of the problematic models.</p>
<p>Almost all of you are told to just start putting efficiency additives and
better fuel into your gas tank.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young">11 distinct forms of MODY</a>,
each caused by a single gene. Different forms share symptoms with both type 1
and type 2. The only way to identify MODY is by family history and expensive
genetic testing.</p>
<p>This is thought to be very rare (less than 0.5% of all cases of diabetes), but
recent research suggests that 3-5% of people currently diagnosed as type 2
actually have some form of MODY.</p>
<h2 id="neonatal-diabetes">Neonatal diabetes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your parents just bought you a brand new car for your 16th birthday. It&rsquo;s the
same model of car they&rsquo;ve been driving for years. For some reason, yours
doesn&rsquo;t work right and needs fuel efficiency additives, or possibly even fuel
injected manually into the engine. There is a very slim (&lt;1% chance) that
the problems will go away over the next few years.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_diabetes_mellitus">Neonatal diabetes</a>
is similar to MODY in that it is caused by a single gene, but is exclusively
diagnosed in infants (usually under 6 months of age). It is almost always
permanent but similar to some forms of MODY, can be effectively treated with
certain oral medications.</p>
<h2 id="mitochondrial-diabetes">Mitochondrial diabetes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your mom bought you a new car. It likely has a hole in the gas tank, but might
just need fuel additives for efficiency. The inside of the car is
sound-proof.</p></blockquote>
<p>This rare form of diabetes is also known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_and_deafness">diabetes and deafness</a>,
and is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (which you get from your
mother). Its symptoms are similar to type 1, but as the name suggests it is also
accompanied by hearing loss.</p>
<h2 id="wolfram-syndrome">Wolfram Syndrome</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a new car. It likely has a hole in the gas tank, and all of the other
fluids also leak. The windshield is painted over and the inside is sound-proof.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_syndrome">Wolfram syndrome</a> or DIDMOAD
(diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness) is a rare
genetic disease that causes diabetes mellitus and insipidus, along with
blindness and deafness (often along with other conditions).</p>
<h2 id="gestational-diabetes">Gestational diabetes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re preparing for a birthday party and have filled your minivan so full of
supplies and toys that it no longer runs very well. Some kid probably sprayed
silly string into the gas tank. Another one might have bumped the washer fluid
tank and started a leak.</p>
<p>Things will probably be better after the celebration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gestational diabetes is a temporary form of diabetes that occurs in some
pregnant women. While this usually goes away after the child is born, pregnancy
is also one of the known trigger events in people at risk for type 1, which can
come on immediately after the pregnancy, or years later. Though it&rsquo;s rarely done,
doctors should test for the autoantibodies that would differentiate &ldquo;regular&rdquo;
gestational diabetes from
<a href="http://adultt1diabetes.blogspot.com/2015/05/autoimmune-gestational-diabetes.html">autoimmune gestational daibetes</a>
that would eventually be diagnosed as type 1.</p>
<hr>
<p>The following terms are also used to describe diabetes mellitus, but for various
reasons they are not officially recognized by the group of experts who have been
put in charge of making those decisions.</p>
<h2 id="type-3">Type 3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your car&rsquo;s GPS nagivation system keeps having you take wrong turns and getting
lost. Some times it loses GPS signal and has no idea where you are. For some
reason, this might somehow be related to your fuel efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_3_diabetes">Type 3 diabetes</a> was
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15750215">proposed in 2005</a> to describe a
form of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease that is caused by insulin resistance within the
brain. Though multiple studies have since confirmed this to be true, it has not
yet been <em>officially</em> recognized as its own form of diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p>Despite the similarity in their names, type 3 has nothing to do with type 3c.</p>
<p>Confusingly, this term is also used by <a href="https://tcoyd.org/category/type-3/">organizations like TCOYD</a> to refer to family/friends of people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are references (e.g. <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/blog/2017/11/diabetes-awareness-month-different-forms-of-diabetes/">here</a>
and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9698930/">here</a>)
to the idea that &ldquo;type 3&rdquo; is used to collect a variety of other specific
classifications, from the recognized <a href="#type-3c">type 3c</a>
to others like 3a and 3b that could refer to <a href="#mody-maturity-onset-diabetes-of-the-young">MODY</a>,
or 3f that could describe diabetes caused by an virus like hepatitis or SARS-Cov-2.</p>
<p><em>I am looking for the original source for these subclassifications for type 3.
Please let me know if you know what it is.</em></p>
<h2 id="type-4">Type 4</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your car isn&rsquo;t working properly and your mechanic might have gotten their
training in Germany or by watching the wrong youtube videos.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of online resources that use the term &ldquo;type 4 diabetes&rdquo; to
This analogy is likely to change because there are multiple competing proposals
to use &ldquo;type 4&rdquo; to refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gestational Diabetes. While there is at least one <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1113665/">older source in english</a>
referring to GD as &ldquo;type 4,&rdquo; most of the more recent information I can find is
in German. The fact that even the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwangerschaftsdiabetes">German Wikipedia entry for GD</a>
references type 4 suggests the usage is fairly common.</li>
<li><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9698930/">Other genetic syndromes occasionally associated with diabetes</a>. <em>I need
more time with this paper. It references a bunch of &ldquo;types&rdquo; that don&rsquo;t seem to
be supported by the citation.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://www.salk.edu/news/salk-news/faq-on-type-4-diabetes/">Diabetes in elderly patients who are not overweight</a>. <em>Note that initial
research from Ronald Evans, Ye Zheng, et. al. was only performed on mice.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28176628/">Glaucoma</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;Brain diabetes.&rdquo; <a href="https://wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pdi.2303">Further research</a> seems to combine the Evans, Zheng,
et. al. theory with research on glaucoma and even the older &ldquo;type 3&rdquo; proposal
related to Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spiddm-and-lada-latent-autoimmune-diabetes-in-adults">SPIDDM and LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You have type 1 but the leak in your gas tank develops slowly. Most of you are
driving older cars.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_in_adults">LADA</a> is an
unofficial term <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8425674">proposed in 1993</a>
that pre-dates the official classification that all autoimmune diabetes mellitus
is type 1 (1995). It is currently used to differentiate the rapid-onset form of
the disease most often seen in young people from the slow-onset form most often
seen in adults.</p>
<p>There are a number of recognized problems with the current criteria used to
describe LADA, so doctors are currently <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021307/">working to define</a>
what is different between LADA and &ldquo;regular&rdquo; type 1.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31819572">SPIDDM</a> or &ldquo;Slowly Progressive
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus&rdquo; is an unofficial term
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13340-014-0199-2">classified in 2015</a>
as one possible answer to the problematic criteria. One or both of these terms
may some day become its own official type, but until then it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;medical
slang&rdquo; because people feel the need to differentiate between those who get type
1 in childhood or as an adult.</p>
<h2 id="double-diabetes">Double Diabetes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re driving a gas-guzzling SUV while your washer fluid tank is also leaking
and causing your gas tank to rust and leak.</p></blockquote>
<p>This unofficial term is used by some people to describe simultaneously having
autoimmune diabetes (Type 1) and severe insulin resistance (which might
otherwise be diagnosed as type 2, or is caused by a different disorder like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>).</p>
<p>Roughly half of people with type 1 are overweight and have mild to severe
insulin resistance (about the same as the non-diabetic population).</p>
<p>Use of this term is discouraged in the medical community because it does not
accurately describe the underlying medical conditions.</p>
<h2 id="type-15">Type 1.5</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You have type 1 but the leak in your gas tank develops slowly. Most of you are
driving older cars.</p>
<p><strong><em>Or</em></strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re driving a gas-guzzling SUV while your washer fluid tank is also leaking
and causing your gas tank to rust and leak.</p></blockquote>
<p>Type 1.5 was <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/issue/vol326no8459/PIIS0140-6736(00)X3205-9">coined in 1985</a>
to describe &ldquo;a condition in which insulin sustains not life itself but the
quality of life&rdquo;. About 8 years later, researchers proposed the term
<a href="lada-latent-autoimmune-diabetes-in-adults">LADA</a> to essentially describe the
same condition in considerably more detail.</p>
<p>Somehow over the years, the term has also started being used to describe a
completely separate condition: <a href="https://www.diabetesincontrol.com/adajdrf-type-1-diabetes-sourcebook-excerpt-1-diagnosing-diabetes/">Type 1 with severe insulin resistance</a>, aka &ldquo;Double Diabetes&rdquo; (described above).</p>
<p>Use of this term is discouraged in the medical community because its two
unrelated definitions cause confusion and does not accurately describe either of
these two unrelated but complex conditions.</p>
<hr>
<p>And then there is the other kind of diabetes:</p>
<h3 id="diabetes-insipidus">Diabetes Insipidus</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Your engine actually works fine. You&rsquo;re driving some other kind of vehicle
entirely, with its own unrelated problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_insipidus">diabetes insipidus</a>
is a completely unrelated disease that only shares the word &ldquo;diabetes&rdquo; in its
name because 500 years ago they were both diagnosed by looking at (and tasting)
people&rsquo;s urine. Diabetes Mellitus tastes/smells sweet like honey, Diabetes
Insipidus is weak and watery.</p>
