        <p>Diabetes Mellitus is a 500 year old term that describes the sweet-smelling urine
of people whose bodies have stopped being able to regulate blood sugar properly.</p>

<p>We now know that it refers to a family of different (and largely unrelated)
diseases that all have the same symptoms before doctors can determine what has
caused them. People &ndash; even doctors &ndash; still have trouble understanding the
differences between these diseases, so I tried to come up with a simple and
(hopefully) humerous analogy by thinking of each disease as a problem with your
car.</p>

<h3 id="type-1">Type 1</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Your washer fluid (something designed to make your car easier/safer to drive)
is leaking onto the gas tank and causing it to rust and develop holes. It
might take weeks or months, but you eventually won&rsquo;t be able to put anymore
gas into your car unless you find a way to bypass the tank and get fuel into
the lines through some other means (maybe a small tank that sits next to you
on the passenger seat, with a hand pump you can squeeze to get fuel into the
engine).</p>

<p>For half of you, the mechanic thinks you&rsquo;re driving an SUV (even you aren&rsquo;t),
doesn&rsquo;t bother to look at your gas tank, and just tells you to start adding
fuel efficiency additives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, caused when the body&rsquo;s own immune
system destroys the cells that produce insulin. It can come on fast (usually in
kids) or slow (usually in adults). While the exact causes are unknown, it is
suspected that the disease is &ldquo;activated&rdquo; in people with at-risk genes by some
sort of environmental trigger event (e.g. illness, stress, pregnancy).</p>

<p>Despite once being called Juvenile Diabetes, more than half of all new cases of
Type 1 are in adults. If misdiagnosis rates were to be corrected, that number
would climb to 75%. This means that half of people with Type 1 remain
misdiagnosed as Type 2.</p>

<h3 id="type-2">Type 2</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re driving an SUV. There are additives that you can add to your fuel to
get better fuel efficiency, but they&rsquo;re usually expensive and work best with
premium fuel. If you don&rsquo;t use these, your fuel efficiency will continue to
get worse.</p>

<p>Friends and strangers ridicule you for buying a gas-guzzling SUV, even though
actually got it as a gift from your parents and can&rsquo;t afford a different car.</p>

<p>20% of you aren&rsquo;t actually driving an SUV, but your mechanic insists that you
are, even if those fuel additives aren&rsquo;t working.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder associated with a body&rsquo;s inability to
use insulin efficiently.  Up to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of Americans have or at risk of developing
this disease. No one knows what causes this disease, but genetics contribute
significantly to your risk. It is not caused by eating too much sugar or being
overweight, but these activities also significantly your risk. Increased insulin
resistance (whether from Type 2, PCOS, or metabolic syndrome) has been known to
cause weight gain. It can&rsquo;t be cured, but some people with Type 2 are able to
effectly keep the disease in remission through medication, and careful control
over diet and exercise.</p>

<p>Despite being the most common form of diabetes, it is also one of the least
understood. The official classification for Type 2 basically says that it is the
diabetes you have if you do <em>not</em> have any other kind of diabetes.</p>

<p>Roughly 20% of people diagnosed as Type 2 are misdiagnosed and actually have
Type 1, Type 3c, or MODY.</p>

<h3 id="type-3c">Type 3c</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>You got rear-ended and your gas tank was damaged so it no longer holds fuel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like Type 1, but you also have to deal with all of the other problems
caused by the collision.</p>

<p>Almost all of you are told to just start putting efficiency additives and
better fuel into your gas tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Type 3c diabetes is caused when the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are
damaged by another disease like pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. It used to be
considered secondary diabetes, but is so prevalent it now has its own
classification.</p>

<p>Over 97% of people with Type 3c are currently misdiagnosed as another kind of
diabetes.</p>

<h3 id="secondary-diabetes">Secondary diabetes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Type 3c but instead of being rear-ended, your mechanic accidentally
poked a hole in your gas tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondary diabetes is caused by damage to the insulin-producing cells in the
pancreas by some external factor not specifically described by another type. The
most common form of secondary diabetes results from side effects to medications
like chemotherapy.</p>

<h3 id="mody-maturity-onset-diabetes-of-the-young">MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re don&rsquo;t realize it but you&rsquo;re driving a Yugo, one of 11 specific kinds of
car that just weren&rsquo;t built to run properly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>very</strong> expensive and time consuming to run a check on your VIN and see
if your car is one of the problematic models.</p>

<p>Almost all of you are told to just start putting efficiency additives and
better fuel into your gas tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are distinct 11 forms of MODY, each caused by a single gene. Different
forms share symptoms with both Type 1 and Type 2. The only way to identify MODY
is by family history and expensive genetic testing. This is thought to be very
rare (less than 0.5% of all cases of diabetes), but recent research suggests
that 3-5% of people diagnosed as Type 2 actually have some form of MODY.</p>

<h3 id="neonatal-diabetes">Neonatal diabetes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Your parents just bought you a brand new car for your 16th birthday.  It&rsquo;s the
same model of car they&rsquo;ve been driving for years. For some reason, yours
doesn&rsquo;t work right and needs fuel efficiency additives, or possibly even fuel
injected manually into the engine. There is a very slim (&lt;1% chance) that
the problems will go away over the next few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neonatal diabetes is similar to MODY in that it is caused by a single gene, but
is exclusively diagnosed in infants (usually under 6 months of age).  It is
almost always permanent but similar to some forms of MODY, can be effectively
treated with certain oral medications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your mom bought you a new car. It likely has a hole in the gas tank, but might
just need fuel additives for efficiency.  The inside of the car is
sound-proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rare form of diabetes is also known as &ldquo;diabetes and deafness&rdquo;, and is
caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (which you get from your mother). Its
symptoms are similar to Type 1, but as the name suggests it is also accompanied
by hearing loss.</p>

<h3 id="gestational-diabetes">Gestational diabetes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re preparing for a birthday party and have filled your minivan so full of
supplies and toys that it no longer runs very well.  Some kid probably sprayed
silly string into the gas tank.</p>

<p>Things will be better after the celebration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gestational diabetes is a temporary form of diabetes that occurs in some
pregnant women. While this usually goes away after the child is born, pregnancy
is also one of the known trigger events in people at risk for Type 1, which can
come on immediately after the pregnancy, or years later. Doctors should, but
rarely test for the autoantibodies that would differentiate &ldquo;regular&rdquo;
gestational diabetes from autoimmune gestational daibetes that will turn into
Type 1 after the pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id="diabetes-insipidus">Diabetes Insipidus</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Your engine actually works fine.  You&rsquo;re driving some other kind of vehicle
entirely, with its own unrelated problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, diabetes insipidus is a completely unrelated disease that only
shares the word &ldquo;diabetes&rdquo; in its name because 500 years ago they were both
diagnosed by looking at (and tasting) people&rsquo;s urine.  Diabetes Mellitus
tastes/smells sweet like honey, Diabetes Insipidus is weak and watery.</p>
