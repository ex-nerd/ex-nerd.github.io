      <description>&lt;p&gt;I plan to eventually write about a bunch of these topics individually.  Until then,
here is my collection of links to a number of diabetes-releated topics that I have found

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Type 1.5&amp;rdquo; was published in an opinion piece in The Lancet (a medical journal) in 1985 which finishes with the passage &amp;ldquo;When diabetes is again reclassified we may find them accommodated in a new category of type 1 1&amp;frasl;2 diabetes &amp;ndash; a condition in which insulin sustains not life itself but the quality of life.&amp;rdquo; This was before the term LADA was coined in 1993 to speak of the same condition &amp;ndash; autoimmune diabetes diagnosed in adulthood (which usually presents itself slowly and back then was thought to be treatable with medications intended for people with what was then called non-insulin dependent diabetes).</description>
